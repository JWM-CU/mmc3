### Overview of Services

<p> 
The Medicine Microscopy Core (MMC) has been established to provide user-friendly yet highly advanced platforms for the acquisition and analysis of light microscopy data. The core provides training, maintenance, and access to state-of-the-art confocal microscopes including a Leica Stellaris 8, a Leica SP8-DLSM light sheet, and a Zeiss LSM710, as well as 2 wide field tissue scanning fluorescence microscopes, 1 live cell imaging microscope, and a fluorescence dissecting microscope. We provide tools for image analysis, such as Leica Aivia 3D machine learning software, and access to an Acquifer HIVE computer server and workstation that can manage large image data sets. The core helps users develop image analysis pipelines, custom computer scripts, and provides imaging expertise and project consultation on a collaborative basis.<br/>
