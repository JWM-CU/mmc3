    ALEXA 790 FLUORESCENT ANTIBODIES AVAILABLE.
    I've recently purchased NIR antibodies that you can use.
    These image nicely on the Stellaris confocal and can allow 6 or more fluorescent channels.
    We have D x Mouse, and G x Rabbit, we should have D x Rabbit soon.

    DISSECTION MICROSCOPE has a reoccurring issue where 
    LASX fails to run and gives error message, 
    "Error creating Hardware Server communication connection". 
    I now believe this is due to lose input cables at the back of the instrument. 
    Please contact me if you get this error.

    ZEISS 710 Confocal. The system is being upgraded to Windows 10 today. 
    This long-standing issue is finally being addressed. Carl from Zeiss is 
    installing a new computer and setting up all the confocal devices in this
    new computer. The old computer will contain any previous FILES of yours, 
    and I will ask CUMC IT to place these on an external hard drive for access.
    IT should also be able to setup the CUMC domain logins today. So we plan 
    to have it operational by tomorrow.
