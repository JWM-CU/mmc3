    The DLS LIGHT SHEET CONFOCAL is now setup with the BRIGHT FIELD CONDENSER. Look on the condenser for the correct software LASX sign in, typically it's "machine.xlhw".
    I switched the condenser to allow bright field imaging (ask me for help/instructions). 
    This system also has multi-well presets in the navigator for automated scanning of 
    multi-well plates and chambers.
